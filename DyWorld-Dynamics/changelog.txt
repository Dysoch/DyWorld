  Major Features:
    - Complete and utter rewrite of DyWorld. Now called DyWorld-Dynamics, this mod is like DyWorld, but better written, less bugs, more features (and almost the same features as DyWorld) and a lot changes!
  Features:
    - Ores have been reworked. There is different percentages of each ore. They can be seperate, or clumped into the same patch.

A lot of different density of ores exist, and each have different byproducts and percentages for them
