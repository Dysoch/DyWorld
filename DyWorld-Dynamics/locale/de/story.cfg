message-act-1-phase-1-1=[color=red]Disclaimer! Die Story und das meiste im Imformatron ist nicht volständig ins deutsche übersetzt! Die fehlenden übersetzungen werden in kürze folgen![/color]\n[color=yellow]I seem to have crash-landed on a planet. My ship is completely fried and on fire. I have no idea what happened to the crew or the ship. Something must have struck us.\nAll I know is that we were flying to the spaceport around Saturn so I could visit my family, and then somehow we were here. An immediate scan of the ship shows that I am the sole survivor of this crash. I have no idea where I am right now. I could see very little things while going down, but this planet is teeming with life.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-1-2=[color=yellow]It appears this planet spins quite fast on its axis, so days and nights are quite short. The gravity of this planet is somewhat different then on Earth, so I have to regain my strength again.\nI have no immediate materials, but some scans around the ship show there are plenty of resources around to be able to construct machines. I want to get off this planet as soon as possible, but it might be prudent to figure out where I am first. But that is of later concern, right now I have nothing, not even the Omega Power Armor or the Pepsillian Laser Rifle like I am used to.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-1-3=[color=yellow]There is alien life around, but scans show they are far away enough to not bother me for a while. I should keep an eye on them though. If only I had COICA, she could scan and tell me what is around.\nLuckily the Informatron database still seems active, which might hold several quick survival tips, like how to gain food and water, or what to create first. I am a little out of my depth for now since I am more an designer then an engineer. But, hopefully I can survive, but I will check the crash site first to see what I can salvage...[/color]

message-act-1-phase-2-1=[color=yellow]It has been hard since the crash. I spend some time working on getting some basic materials, and to my suprise Ores here are quite different. They have different impurities and purities within the same vein.\nA quick scan shows that there are Iron, Copper and Tin Ore veins around. This means I can get started on creating Bronze. Luckily the Kilns I created can manage that. It will be a while before I reach Steel or even Duralumin. [/color]
message-act-1-phase-2-2=[color=yellow]I should explore around the crash site for a bit. I wont explore far from the crash-site, but scans show there are creatures closeby. They might not be friendly, but luckily I found a pistol and some bullets in the crash-site, should take them with me just in case. There is also an basic rover in the ship, which is still usable.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-2-3=[color=yellow]What also came to mind is that I should name the planet and its Sun. For this Sun I decided on [color=cyan]Calidus[/color], which means Fiery. For the planet I decided [color=cyan]Nauvis[/color], meaning new. It is somewhat fitting for both.\nI started on a new planet, and Calidus gave a few Coronal Mass Ejections on the planet as I crash landed. Maybe this is why I crashed here, but this still does not explain where I am, and why I cant reach Earth[/color]

message-act-1-phase-3-1=[color=yellow]I explored around the area, and came across several creatures. After studying them from a distance, I went for a closer look. This was a mistake. They are not friendly.\nMy suit scanned them while I attacked them, and they appear to become hostile due to the pollution from my machines. I should expand carefully, and probably work on some kind of defense.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-3-2=[color=yellow]After thinking about it, bronze is within my grasp. Copper and tin are closeby, so bronze can be made. I can probably fashion that into some kind of armor. As for defenses, walls are probably the best bet.\nStone bricks can be turned into a rudimentary wall, good enough to defend for a bit. I will also fashion very simple turrets from 9mm pistols, so defending is automated.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-4-1=[color=yellow]A few simple defenses are done. Some turrets set up with some walls. This should be enough for a while, but I should expand my defenses as I expand my base.\nThere is a problem however. To make the 9mm bullets, I need charcoal. My suit has detected a patch of fertile soil nearby. I can probably make some basic treefarms, send some water and then I should have wood. This will also reduce my pollution output a bit.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-4-2=[color=yellow]I set my suit to also scan around me to see where I am. Its results are quite troublesome. There is a massive energy signature somewhere, maybe even the reason I am here.\nA scan of the sky at night resulted nothing in relation to Earth. The stars visible from Earth can not be seen from here. Where am I? My suits scanner is not effective at this task, so I might have to build a stronger scanner soon.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-5-1=[color=yellow]I finally have enough materials to start automating. Rudimentary automation, but still automation. I can use factory style transport belts to transport materials, use fuel inserters and kilns to automate bronze. Eventually I can grow big enough to expand even more. I should be careful with expanding though, the natives do not like me.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-5-2=[color=yellow]My scans from the last several days almost overlooked something. There is a very faint energy signature coming from my crash-site. I decided to scan it more detailed, but this will take time. Then I can find out what it is, and if I can use it.\nIt appears to come from the Core room of the ship that drove the anti-matter engine. Maybe something useful can be found there, but the radiation is to strong.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-6-1=[color=yellow]Okay the scan is done. It is amazing this survived. Apparantly[/color] [color=blue]Core Aplica Intelligent Coordinated Assistant[/color][color=yellow], or [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] for short, survived the crash as well. This AI is super powerful. She holds insane amount of information in her database, which I can access if I can house her into something.[/color]\n[color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] is so powerful, she can build, plan, design and scan things. Also it would be great to have somebody to talk to.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-6-2=[color=yellow]There is however a problem. The current materials are not strong enough to house it. I should progress towards iron, it might be strong enough for this. I will house [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] in my armor, allowing it to be by my side as I explore. Eventually she can become powerful enough to be base wide, but for now, she must stay with me.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-7-1=[color=yellow]Trying to retrieve [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] is harder then it first looked. The AI is so complex that even extraction from the core is troublesome. A wrong move, and COICA is gone and all my chances of survival are gone. While trying to extract it though, I retrieved about 6 recipe blueprints. Two were decrypted almost right away, the rest is going to take a while. The recipes that are decrypted are a med pack and stronger bullets. These things will certainly help me defend around the crash-site.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-7-2=[color=yellow]I have been giving some thought on how to implement [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color].[color=yellow] It seems the properties of the metals on this planet are slightly amplified compared to those on Earth. This might give COICA a chance to be properly implemented. Luckily, I already found the [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] implant base in the ship after I crashed. Soon I can start with proper exploration and figuring out why everything happened.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-8-1=[color=yellow]Okay, the remaining 4 recipes are unlocked, and they are for copper and iron. It seems [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] is helping me, without my knowledge. They are ineffecient recipes though, but it will do for now. Eventually I will get to bloomeries and blast furnaces, and maybe even fusion crafting.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-8-2=[color=yellow]The scanner is still picking up that massive energy signal. Last night I could have sworn I saw light and movement in the sky. I am starting to think there is more intelligent life than myself and the natives (if you can call them intelligent, they seem to be a form of massive spiderlike ant with basic instincts). I should really hurry with getting [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow], before whatever else is on this planet finds me...[/color]

message-act-1-phase-9-1=[color=yellow]Finally, [/color][color=blue]COICA[/color][color=yellow] is extracted. The recipe for it is done. It is going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time to craft, but I should make this a priority. When crafted, I should be able to build and repair my walls a lot quicker. After it is built, it will take some time to start up, but I can probably do logic first so it can start up while crafting it. [/color]
message-act-1-phase-9-2=[color=yellow]The natives are getting more and more restless. There is something weird going on on this planet. Their attacks still keep coming, it seems with greater strength. Last night something happened again. Instead of moving lights and noise like a few nights ago, there was some kind of aurora in the sky. I can still see during the day. I think it is not a natural thing. I can feel some kind of power emanating from it. Better hurry with crafting COICA, it can probably figure out what is happening.[/color]

message-act-1-phase-10-1=[color=blue]COICA starting up ..... \nActivating ....... DONE\nCrash detected. Increasing security level to survival mode, all security levels available.\nCommander, how can I help you?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]COICA, can you scan the planet and where it is located from Earth?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Of course Commander, doing so now.\nScanning .. scanning .. scanning ..[/color]
message-act-1-phase-10-2=[color=blue]Commander, scan complete. Location of the planet in relevance to Earth undetermined. Scans show weird constellations, not familiar with Earth point of view. Expanding to known human settlements on other planets reveal the same information. Stars do not align with the Milky Way or Andromeda.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Okay that is weird. Maybe you can find something more once we build a stronger scanner. What about this planet?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]This planet is much like Earth. Atmosphere content very similar to Earth, but carbon-dioxide is not found on the planet other then what you produced Commander. Something else is producing the greenhouse effect that CO2 normally does. Picking up a very powerful energy signature all around us. It is in the atmosphere and the ground. Location of the main source is hard to find, please give me a few minutes to try and locate it.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]That might explain the auroras and the way the natives act. Can it also explain why the ship crashed?[/color]
message-act-1-phase-10-3=[color=blue]Scans of the ship show it was bombarded by some kind of exotic energy. This kind of energy could in theory puncture a hole into spacetime. However, this kind of energy was never proved by scientists.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Mmm, this all seems weird. Exotic energy, and some kind of energy that is on this planet. Could they be connected?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]They could, but this requires scanning equipment we currently don not have access to. You should get working on that. Unlocking some recipes to create basic energy, alongside buildings that use that energy. We should also research the ores on this planet, this will allow us to figure out a way to purify them and make great strides into getting off the planet. I created a building to do the research for it. This, plus 6 recipes are now unlocked and ready to be used.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-10-4=[color=yellow]Finally, now we are getting somewhere.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Energy signature located. It is found on another planet. The energy signature is most likely coming from an large metallic object, that produces some kind of exotic energy.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]That is far away! How is can a machine on another planet cause effects here?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]I have no idea Commander. There is a problem however. By scanning for the energy signature I seem to have attracted something. There is a sizable metallic object heading this way. It seems to be hostile, and approaching fast.[/color]
message-act-1-phase-10-5=[color=yellow]What? How? Can you find out what it is so I can properly defend against it?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]I am sorry Commander, scans reveal nothing. It does carry however the same exotic energy as what happened to the spaceship. I am also picking up a strange transmission[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Crap, okay, will create basic energy quick, focus on defense automation. Maybe whatever it is the guns might shoot it down.....[/color]

message-act-2-phase-1-1=[color=yellow]Commander, scans show 5 metallic objects are here. TAKE COVER[/color]\n\n\n[color=red]DYSOCH: WARNING, MASSIVE LAG INBOUND! (lower performance option coming soon)[/color]

message-act-2-phase-2-1=[color=yellow]Commander, are you okay?[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Yes I am. What was that that hit us? And why am I still alive?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Those were missiles with massive amount of exotic energy. It destroyed everything within 250 meters. I have no clue why you are alive, but I suspect somebody or something wanted to warn you[/color]\n\n[color=blue]You may be right. Try to find out if we can discover a way to defend against it. For now I will focus on rebuilding my base.[/color]

message-act-2-phase-3-1=[color=yellow]Commander, we need to find a way to survive this kind of energy. Every kind of energy can be shielded against, so this must be possible for the exotic energy as well.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Yes I agree. We need to find a shield for this. But more importantly, is there a way to automate medpack usage? Sort of like a automatic stimpack user.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Mmm yes this might be possible. I will see if I can manufacture one. I will make it an implant, allowing you to switch it on and off.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Good. Also, see if you can try to make it for food and water intake as well.[/color]

message-act-2-phase-4-1=[color=yellow]Commander? We need to study the planet. In order to find out what actually happened to the ship, we need some scans all around the planet. Use radars to keep scanning while you build up your base.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Why COICA?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]This is to determine if the exotic energy, both natural and the ones from the blast are the same levels at different places. This might give some more information about the energy, its purpose and where it is coming from.[/color]

message-act-2-phase-5-1=[color=blue]COICA, what did you find?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]A lot of things. Chemical analyses show there are deposits of oil and natural gas. This can probably be used to get to space and get power. To get into oil cracking, you require the new research labratory, the chemical labratory. It uses fluids and gases, and will allow you to progress further. I unlocked it several days ago for you Commander.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Good, will get started on it right away. Is there any change in the energy on the planet? I don not want a repeat of a few days ago where we were blasted away.[/color]
message-act-2-phase-5-2=[color=yellow]Monitoring it, and once it changes, I will warn you. For now I am still scanning the night sky, to find our location.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Good. I will get started on going towards Oil Cracking.[/color]

message-act-2-phase-6-1=[color=yellow]Commander, there is something weird with planet. Since everything is saturated with exotic energy, I found that killing the natives has a very small chance to release some exotic particles.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]What can we do with these particles?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]For now, nothing. I am still scanning everything around us. It might be possible to use it for energy, warfare and even building. But it requires more time before we can figure it out. For now, store everything you find[/color]

message-act-2-phase-7-1=[color=yellow]Commander, I have a plan.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]What kind of plan?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Finding out where this planet is is impossible on the surface. We need to go to space. We need to launch rockets to study around us. For now we need to stay on the planet though, but there is an asteroid belt closeby, so we can gain materials from it while we scan around.[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Why stay on the planet?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]There are still things we should do first. It is going to require a large amount of resources in order to go the space. For now focus on getting towards rocket silos[/color]

message-act-2-phase-8-1=[color=yellow]Commander, you are getting closer to the rocket silo. Keep going. I will keep scanning the planet in the meantime. Be sure to have some radars around so it can help me[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Did you find anything about the origin of the energy signature, or its purpose?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]Only tiny details. My initial assumption that it was coming from an planet seems to be wrong. I can not find out where it is though. But after careful examination, it seems the exotic energy is used to grow the natives. No reason why or how though[/color]\n\n[color=blue]That is weird. Hopefully we can find out soon[/color]

message-act-2-phase-9-1=[color=yellow]Okay Commander, build the silo, and send some rockets into space. There are several satellites you can send to gain some resources. Each send will scan the planet and its place in the universe[/color]\n\n[color=blue]How many satellites you need in space?[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]For now, 5 should do. This will hopefully pinpoint the exact location of the structure making the exotic energy.[/color]

message-act-2-phase-10-1=[color=yellow]Okay Commander, I have bad news. I can still not pinpoint the exact location. My sensors are still overloaded by the exotic energy[/color]\n\n[color=blue]How come you were wrong? I thought this would work[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]I thought so as well, our next objective would be to send more, eventually we can find something. I will start researching if there is a way to get to other planets with the current materials we have.[/color]
