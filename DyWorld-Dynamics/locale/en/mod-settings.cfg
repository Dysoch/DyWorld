[mod-setting-description]
DyWorld_Debug=Debug Mode: [color=red]USE AT OWN RISK![/color] A lot of scripted info will be displayed, which will clutter the screen
DyWorld_Combat_Overhaul=Combat Overhaul, which makes bullets hit the first thing, travel in the world and make combat a lot harder, but more fun\n[color=red](USE AT OWN RISK, HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AT THE MOMENT!)[/color]
DyWorld_Light_Setting=Player Light Increase. Same as Afraid of the Dark mod, but internally added into DyWorld. \nAdded because [color=red]Afraid of the Dark is incompatible with DyWorld-Dynamics[/color]\nMainly added for Youtubers, but usable for normal players as well
DyWorld_Expensive_Modifier=Expensive recipe modifier. This number multiplies the normal recipes for the expensive recipes. \nNumbers with decimals are allowed for fine tuning \n(minimum = 1, maximum = 1.000)
DyWorld_Expensive_Tech_Modifier=Expensive technology modifier. This number multiplies the normal usage of science packs\nNumbers with decimals are allowed for fine tuning \n(minimum = 0 (free, basically just 1 item), maximum = 100.000)\nScript will default everything to its maximum integer value if it hits the ceiling
DyWorld_Phase_Messages=Disabling this does not shows the new recipes unlocked message anymore
DyWorld_Attack_Messages=Determines if the Attack messages are shown
DyWorld_Show_Resistances=Shows Building Resistances in their tooltip. Does clutter the screen a bit, so disabled by default
DyWorld_Tech_Upgrade=This will enable the upgrade tech for all DyWorld technologies, which makes the technology screen less cluttered. This will however make it harder to check the next technology in the same line without searching the actual technology tree (right side of the screen)
DyWorld_Attack_Difficulty=Custom Difficulty multiplier for scripted attacks.\nPeaceful: No attacks\nEasy: Standard attacks\nMedium: 3x more powerful then Easy\nHard: 3x more powerful then Medium\nDeath: 3x more powerful then Hard
