[mod-setting-description]
DyWorld_Debug=Debug Mode: USE AT OWN RISK! A lot of scripted info will be displayed, which will clutter the screen
DyWorld_Combat_Overhaul=Combat Overhaul, which makes bullets hit the first thing, travel in the world and make combat a lot harder, but more fun
DyWorld_Light_Setting=Player Light Increase. Same as Afraid of the Dark mod, but internally added into DyWorld. Added because AotD is incompatible with DyWorld-Dynamics
