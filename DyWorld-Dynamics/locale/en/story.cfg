message-phase-2="Personal Log #2\nDate: __1__ day(s) after crash, give or take...\n\nIt's been hard since the crash. This planet is different then I expected. Resources are weird. Instead of purging the impurities out of the ores like on other planets, here it grew in both impure and pure variants, in the same vein! I have no idea how this is possible, but it will save time in the long run, as I don't have to purify most of it.\n\nI have started creating a few basic Kilns. This will help me create some materials. It's weird to start all the way from the beginning. I can't create any type of steel or exotic metals, since the infrastructure is not here for it. This will take some time, so back to basics. Start with bronze, and move up to steel and other metals.\n\nI came to mind that I should probably name the planet. I have giving it some thoughts, and decided on "Nauvis". This means "new". I should also explore around the crash site a bit. Better take my pistol and ammo with me, as the natives might not be friendly. Before I go, i should probably place a few mining drills with some storages. Then i can gather some materials while I explore ........."
