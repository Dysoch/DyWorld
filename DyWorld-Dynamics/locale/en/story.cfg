message-phase-2="Personal Log #2 \nDate: __1__ days after crash, give or take... \n\nIt's been a day since the crash. I got some basic setup to extract some minerals up and running. At night I had the opportunity to see the surroundings. There were some lights far away, but I have no idea from what they can be. The mining operation is showing some signs of pollution, so I might have to watch out for that, don’t want to pollute my only source of air. Should upgrade to electric miners soon, they pollute a bit less, and are faster. For terms of power, I have no idea yet. I can make a basic steam engine setup, but this is a lot of work, since the water close by is not usable in steam engines. While I was chopping some trees, my hand scanner noticed something weird. Those trees are more then 100.000 years old! So I decided to carbon date a few things, if that even might work here, and it did. Everything here is older then 100.000 years, some even almost 500.000 years. How is it possible? It shouldn’t be possible, living things have an expiration date of sorts, so this defies the laws of nature that we know. This got me thinking, I should name the planet since I am stuck here. Looking back at what I have learned about everything here being so old, so I have decided to name the planet"
