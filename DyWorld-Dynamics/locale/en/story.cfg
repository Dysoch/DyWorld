message-act-1-phase-2="Commander's Log #2\nDate: __1__ day(s) after the crash, give or take...\n\nIt's been hard since the crash. This planet is different then I expected. Resources are weird. Instead of purging the impurities out of the ores like on other planets, here it grew in both impure and pure variants, in the same vein! I have no idea how this is possible, but it will save time in the long run, as I don't have to purify most of it.\n\nI have started creating a few basic Kilns. This will help me create some materials. It's weird to start all the way from the beginning. I can't create any type of steel or exotic metals, since the infrastructure is not here for it. This will take some time, so back to basics. Start with bronze, and move up to steel and other metals.\n\nIt came to mind that I should probably name the planet. I have giving it some thoughts, and decided on "Nauvis". This means "new". I should also explore around the crash site a bit. Better take my pistol and ammo with me, as the natives might not be friendly. Before I go, I should probably place a few mining drills with some storages. Then i can gather some materials while I explore ........."
message-act-1-phase-3="Commander’s Log #3 \nDate: __1__ days after the crash. \n\nOkay, I just had a “not so friendly” talk with the natives. They are really hostile! Scans of them show that they will most likely attack as a direct result of the pollution from my machines. This means that I should be careful expanding! \n\nBut I should also focus on defenses. I can probably use some stones to make a rudimentary wall and some turrets. This should be enough for the time being. For personal protection a simple type of armor should be fine for now. \n\nI should start getting ready to make bronze. This helps with defenses, and should be the basis for creating more advanced materials.....”
message-act-1-phase-4="Commander’s Log #4 \nDate: __1__ days after the crash. \n\nOkay, defenses are done for a bit. Nothing fancy, just a few walls and some 9mm turrets. But I ran into a problem. To make the 9mm bullets, I need charcoal, which is made from wood. \n\nA simple scan around the ship shows a patch of fertile soil closeby. Make a few basic treefarms, supply it with water, and I got wood sort of automated. Should do this ASAP, it will help with pollution as well. \n\nThe scan also found an energy signature far away. It was quite a powerful signal, might be the reason I am here. It also scanned the sky. Initial survey of the night sky reveals nothing useful. The stars found in the sky at night are unknown by my scanner. This might mean that I am extremely far away from the Sol System and Earth. But, the scanner is rudimentary for this task, so I might have to build a stronger one to scan more enhanced. This could reveal my location based from Earth."
message-act-1-phase-5="Commander’s Log #5 \n\nDate: __1__ days after the crash. \n\nIt's finally time! I have all the materials needed to start working on automation. Sure, it's still all rudimentary, but it works. I have a couple of idea's. I will use factory style belts to transport materials all over the base, sorting it where it's needed. I can use simple fuel based inserters and kilns to have my bronze creation automated. Sure it's all very simple, but it's always better then manually doing everything. Next step is obviously creating the intermediates automatically, but let's focus on this first ...... \n\nThe scan i did a few days ago of my surroundings found something else. I almost looked over it, it was such a small signal. I thought that when the ship crashed all electronics were fried, but I was wrong. It seems there is a very faint energy signal coming from the ship. I don't know what it is yet, so did a more detailed scan of the ship. It's still analyzing, but it appears the signal is coming from what used to be the core room. Hopefully before next I write the next log I know what it is ....."
message-act-1-phase-6="Commander’s Log #6 \n\nDate: __1__ days after the crash. \n\nReally good news! The signal from the ship is indeed coming from the core room. I had hoped that some part of the core was intact, but sadly not the case. What is sending out a signal however is the next best thing: Core Aplica Intelligent Coordinated Assistant, or COICA. The ship's AI system is still active! This is really good news, because the database COICA holds is immense. It can help with building, designing and scanning. Side note, it will also help me stay sane. I am getting quite lonely not talking to somebody, and COICA can help me also there. \n\nThere is however a problem. The current materials I have now are insuffecient to house COICA. I need to create iron and copper, combine it with tin and bronze and I might have a chance to house it. I think I will add it into my armor, so I need to make sure a better armor is available. Luckily that should be able with iron and copper as well. It's a long shot, but well worth it.”
