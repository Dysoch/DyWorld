message-act-1-phase-1-1=I seem to have crash-landed on a planet. My ship is completely fried and on fire. I have no idea what happened to the crew or the ship. Something must have struck us. All I know is that we were flying to the spaceport around Saturn so I could visit my family, and then somehow we were here. An immediate scan of the ship shows that I am the sole survivor of this crash. I have no idea where I am right now. I could see very little things while going down, but this planet is teeming with life.
message-act-1-phase-1-2=It appears this planet spins quite fast on its axis, so days and nights are quite short. The gravity of this planet is somewhat different then on Earth, so I have to regain my strength again. I have no immediate materials, but some scans around the ship show there are plenty of resources around to be able to construct machines. I want to get off this planet as soon as possible, but it might be prudent to figure out where I am first. But that is of later concern, right now I have nothing, not even the Omega Power Armor or the Pepsillian Laser Rifle like I am used to.
message-act-1-phase-1-3=There is alien life around, but scans show they are far away enough to not bother me for a while. I should keep an eye on them though. If only I had COICA, she could scan and tell me what is around. Luckily the Informatron database still seems active, which might hold several quick survival tips, like how to gain food and water, or what to create first. I am a little out of my depth for now since I am more an designer then an engineer. But, hopefully I can survive, but I will check the crash site first to see what I can salvage...

message-act-1-phase-2-1=It has been hard since the crash. I spend some time working on getting some basic materials, and to my suprise Ores here are quite different. They have different impurities and purities within the same vein. A quick scan shows that there are Iron, Copper and Tin Ore veins around. This means I can get started on creating Bronze. Luckily the Kilns I created can manage that. It will be a while before I reach Steel or even Duralumin. 
message-act-1-phase-2-2=I should explore around the crash site for a bit. I wont explore far from the crash-site, but scans show there are creatures closeby. They might not be friendly, but luckily I found a pistol and some bullets in the crash-site, should take them with me just in case. There is also an basic rover in the ship, which is still usable.
message-act-1-phase-2-3=What also came to mind is that I should name the planet and its Sun. For this Sun I decided on Calidus, which means Fiery. For the planet I decided Nauvis, meaning new. It is somewhat fitting for both. I started on a new planet, and Calidus gave a a few Coronal Mass Ejections on the planet as I crash landed. Maybe this is why I crashed here, but this still does not explain where I am, and why I cant reach Earth
