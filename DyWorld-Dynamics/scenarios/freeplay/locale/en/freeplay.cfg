msg-intro="Personal Log #1\nLocation: Unknown\n\nI have crash landed on a weird planet. All my instruments are dead and power to the ship is completely fried and on fire with explosions. I have no idea what happened to me, my ship or crew. One moment I was flying to Saturn to visit some family in the space station, the next I was flying like a fireball above some weird terrain. The crash was hard, destroyed the ship and killed all the crew except me. Luckily I found a few things to build. My degree in engineering and designing will certainly help me there.\n\nWhen I was going down towards this planet, I could see some things. There is so much life on this planet! I could see trees, bushes and even some walking creatures. They all seemed different, but it was hard to see, so I am not completely sure. Could have also sworn that I saw some ruins, but it went by so fast. \n\nThere are plenty of metals around, so should be able to construct something to send for help. It will probably take a while, since I have almost nothing to start with. A scan around my ship shows no immediate signs of life, so I might be safe for a while. Still, should prepare for the worst, those creatures might not be friendly. Luckily I found a basic gun in the ship with some ammo, so I can defend myself if I need to. This planet spins quite fast, so days and night are short, and the gravity is stronger then I am used too. This means I have to regain my strength slowly again. Well, lets get to work, I want to get off this planet as soon as I possible can!"
msg-intro-2=A few tips to start the game:\n - DyWorld has a RPG system, access it with its default key of NUMPAD 5.\n - Trees and Stones are the only thing the player can mine manually. The rest is can only be mined by a certain tier miner.\n - The player does NOT heal automatically. Use med packs like capsules (aka throw them) to heal\n - Use the Story menu to progress into the game. This unlocks recipes, technologies and a fancy story. Default key: NUMPAD 6.\n - WIP\n - WIP\n - Tier 0 (start of the game) is designed to be hard! You might die sometimes.\n - WIP\n - WIP\n - Ore Deposits have different densities. This basically means that not all ores might be able to be extracted. (percentage based mining, with many different resources and percentages of the same ore. Each have different ratio’s of byproducts compared to their density) You can’t however, find out what the density or percentage is
