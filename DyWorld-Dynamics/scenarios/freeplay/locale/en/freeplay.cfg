msg-intro="Personal Log #1\nDate: Unknown\nGalaxy: Unknown\nStar System: Unknown\nPlanet: Unknown\nLocation: Unknown\n\nI have crash landed on a planet. All my instruments are dead and power to the ship is completely fried, and on fire with explosions. I have no idea what happened to me, or my ship or crew. One moment I was flying to Saturn to visit some family in the space station, the next I was flying like a fireball above some weird terrain. The crash was hard, and destroyed the ship and killed all the crew except me. Luckily I found some stuff to build a few things. My degree in engineering and designing will certainly help me there.\n\nWhen I was going down towards this planet, I could see some things. There is so much life here! I could see trees, bushes and even some walking creatures. They all seemed different, but it was hard to see, so I donâ€™t know. Could have also sworn that I saw some ruins, but it went by so fast, so I am not completely sure. \n\nThere are plenty of metals around, so should be able to construct something to send for help. It will probably take a while, since I have almost nothing to start with. A scan around my ship shows no immediate life, so I might be safe for a while. Still, should prepare for the worst, those creatures might not be friendly. Luckily I found a basic gun in the ship with some ammo, so I can defend myself if I need to. Funnily enough, this planet spins quite fast, so days and night are short, and the gravity is stronger then I am used too. This means I have to regain my strength slowly again. Well, lets get to work, I want to get off this planet as soon as I possible can!"
msg-intro-2=A few tips to start the game:\n - DyWorld has a RPG system, access it with its default key of NUMPAD 5.\n - Trees and Stones are the only thing the player can mine manually. The rest is can only be mined by a certain tier miner.\n - The player does NOT heal automatically. Use med packs like capsules (aka throw them) to heal\n - Use the Story menu to progress into the game. This unlocks recipes, technologies and a fancy story. Default key: NUMPAD 6.\n - Corpses of all biological entities can be used. Save your enemy corpses, you will need them later.\n - Stay weary of the natives! They will attack somewhere soon! (even on peacefull, this is intended)\n - Tier 0 (start of the game) is designed to be hard! You might die sometimes.\n - Get stuff from the crash site quickly, then leave immediately! The crash site is radioactive for 24 hours unless you are wearing a radiation armor!\n - Don't progress to fast! Attacks might happen at certain steps in the story!
