  Minor Features:
    - NOTE: this update is released ahead of schedule, and does not contain all features that were originally planned for this update. These features have been pushed back to next update. This was done to fix a few issue's that were troubling for KatherineOfSky's playthrough on Youtube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRT6uW2NOtA&list=PL4o6UvJIdPNqubR5oXdx9SqKFoYW_SL-q )
    - Mining trees now have an extremely low chance (0.5%) to give food items. Can be used to heal yourself, or for farming which can give more food related items

    - Stone resources now has a chance to give sand when mined
    - Added dedicated water boiler. This heats water to 95 degrees (doesn't create steam!)
  QoL:

    - Starting ships replaced by new base game graphics. Broken down stuff sadly, will recieve update in next versions to repair them
    - Random debris can now be found in the starting area. This holds scrap metal (which gives some random stuff), corpses of your crew mates and impact craters. More to come in coming updates to bring more life into the world
    - During your crash landing, a lot of stuff has been ejected before you hit the ground. Some chests can be found further away from the starting area, these are hard to find, but give rewarding loot (all items in game can spawn in it!) Its quite far away though, and each one generated makes the next one even further generated.
    - Added a lot new intermediates! Total over 100 items! 
  RPG/GUI:
    - Removed the Needs and Story systems. Were unfinished and are pushed back to far away
    - Changed the way you gain XP. Mining, Crafting and Building have diminishing XP gains. This is item specific, so Mining, Crafting or Building different items have different XP. Max XP gain for Mining after 1000 mined is 0.25 XP, for Crafting its 0.05 XP after 260 crafted and building is 0.05 XP gained after 10.000 build. Build, mine and craft many different things!
    - Revamped Distance GUI. Now has 4 modes. First will show the crashed ships, always active. 2: You can toggle Map Labels on/off in settings, will show distances. 3/4: These modes are not completely implemented yet, but show resource and player distances when done

    - Add specialised Ore Cracking Recipes. They are locked behind purple science, but give you the ability to get just one ore, instead of multiple
    - Ported to Factorio 0.17.x
  RPG:
    - Bonuses and Attributes are now calculated every minute, instead of every second (it updated when the RPG Stats GUI refreshed in previous releases). Formula's became more complex, and updating every second lags the game insanely
    - The RPG Stats GUI and Needs GUI now all update every 5 seconds, instead of every second (more checks added, increasing lag spikes on slower computers). 
    - The Distance GUI now can only be opened when the RPG Stats GUI is closed! This fixes bouncing GUI's
    - Most bonuses can only become active when certain conditions are met. Mostly levels, but some have a throshold in their corresponding statistic.
    - Leveling is much easier in DyWorld now, to compensate for some bonuses being locked in levels beyond level 20
    - A bit smaller text in all GUI's, so that it wont cover a huge part the screen. Size reduced by 15-20%

    - Removed seperate technologies of Modules, Tanks and Locomotives. THey are unlocked as a batch now

    - Metallurgy and Modules settings removed. They are now part of the core of DyWorld!
    - Reduced min range of turrets a lot
    - A lot better migration script, which doesnt result in increased stats (RPG wise) whenever a migration was done.
    - Launching a satellite doesnt finish the game anymore. Now you have to launch the DTX-001 Spaceship.
    - Launching with any item with a rocket doesnt bring up the message anymore that a satellite wasnt added

  Balancing:
    - Accumulators now hold 2.5x more charge

    - Steam Engines now have set fluid usage, making energy produced more sensible
    - Storage Tanks now act as valves. This means that any connecting pipe that is an input into a tank has to be at least 80% full before it can fill the tank. Output is unchanged though. This feature can be override by adding a pump before going into tanks
    - Added one way pipes! This will balance both output and input with each other, one way obviously. Will not start outputting till input is at least 10% full. Can be connected to circuit network to read pipe contents
  Materials System:
    - Gold now has 4x more conductivity
  Metallurgy:
