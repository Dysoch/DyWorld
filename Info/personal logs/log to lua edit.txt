"Commanderâ€™s Log #4 \nDate: __1__ days after the crash. \nOkay, defenses are done for a bit. Nothing fancy, just a few walls and some 9mm turrets. But I ran into a problem. To make the 9mm bullets, I need charcoal, which is made from wood. \nA simple scan around the ship shows a patch of fertile soil closeby. Make a few basic treefarms, supply it with water, and I got wood sort of automated. Should do this ASAP, it will help with pollution as well. \nThe scan also found an energy signature far away. It was quite a powerful signal, might be the reason I am here. Initial survey of the night sky reveals nothing useful. The stars found in the sky at night are unknown by my scanner. This might mean that I am extremely far away from the Sol System and Earth. But, the scanner is rudimentary for this task, so I might have to build a stronger one to scan more enhanced. This could reveal my location based from Earth."
