-- TO DO PHASE 3 DEVELOPMENT --

If I may make a suggestion... is it possible to have all the tabs on top at all times?  (And click on them to expand?)  I feel like its easy to forget the numpad keys, especially for people new to mods.  The objectives tab, specifically is going to generate a LOT of questions: e.g. I cant make progress, what am I supposed to do? end

Rework electricity
