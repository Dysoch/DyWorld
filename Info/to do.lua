-- TO DO PHASE 3 DEVELOPMENT --

If I may make a suggestion... is it possible to have all the tabs on top at all times?  (And click on them to expand?)  I feel like its easy to forget the numpad keys, especially for people new to mods.  The objectives tab, specifically is going to generate a LOT of questions: e.g. I cant make progress, what am I supposed to do? end

Rework electricity 
(if you put a full stack of coal in a burner assembler it will last for 55 hours)
