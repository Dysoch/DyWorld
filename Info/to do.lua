iron stages:

cast iron recipe tier 0:
2 iron ore, 1 charcoal > 1 iron plate

cast iron (2-4% carbon) recipe tier 1:
into bloomery with charcoal and oxygen canister (less efficient)
50 ore > 35 iron plate

wrought iron (0.08% carbon) process
into blast furnace with limestone and charcoal and liquid oxygen (more efficient)
100 ore > 95 iron plate

steel (0.8-2% carbon) process
into blast furnace with limestone and coal and liquid oxygen (more efficient)
200 ore > 80 steel plate
