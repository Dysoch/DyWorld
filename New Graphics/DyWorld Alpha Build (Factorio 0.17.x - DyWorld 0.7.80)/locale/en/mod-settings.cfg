[mod-setting-description]
DyWorld_Debug=Debug settings, not needed for most people. This shows a lot on screen what happens! USE AT OWN RISK!
DyWorld_Extraction=Extract a lot of resources with these new Extraction tools, Drills and more
DyWorld_Logistics=Inserters, Pipes, Pumps and so much more. For all your logistic needs!
DyWorld_Modules=Modules that use the Material System to give it different stats!
DyWorld_Power=When you use all other modules, its kinda hard to power it. This module will solve it, with everything energy combined into one module
DyWorld_Processing=Processing at its finest. Higher quality machines to help you produce faster!
DyWorld_Warfare=When War is in your blood and you want moaaarrr!
DyWorld_Story=CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT BALANCED/WORKING! USE AT OWN RISK!
DyWorld_Metallurgy=Smelting and Mixing at the highest quality! Liquid metals!
DyWorld_Needs=CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT BALANCED/WORKING! USE AT OWN RISK!
DyWorld_Warfare_Difficulty=Enemies Difficulty. This makes the game a lot harder! Use these values: \n 1 : Easy Mode (Noob Mode) \n 2 : Normal Mode (Default) \n 3 : Hard Mode (Fighter Mode) \n 4 : Super Hard Mode (Berserker Mode) \n 5 : Death Mode (Easy Death Mode!)
DyWorld_Equipment=New Equipments! This module looks at which other modules are enabled and acts accordingly. Power enabled? More solar panels equipment. Warfare? More ways to fight!
DyWorld_Hidden_Recipes=Hides certain recipes when enabled to avoid making the crafting window big. Disable to see what recipes do, and where to craft them
DyWorld_Infinite_Resources=Enable this if you want infinite resources instead of finite ones. Works with RSO!
DyWorld_Chemistry=Chemistry, the art of working with sub-atomic particles!
DyWorld_Stack_Size_Mult=Dont like the stack size the way it is now? Or just want to see how much you can stockpile? Increase this! The orginal stacksize is multiplied with this number
DyWorld_Circuit_Components_Auto_Craft=Option to the manual crafting of circuit and pcb components. Enabled it will auto craft in inventory when a circuit is pressed. Remember, this requires more resources amd thus should be avoided. Use specialised assemblers to make them easier and cheaper!
DyWorld_Roboport_Standard=Standard, Tiered Roboport Ranges that are not defined by the Material System, but by tier. This gives small ranges at lower levels, and goes higher per tier
DyWorld_PvP=This will shut off the RPG system that causes a lot of bugs with PVP. Will be fixed in upcoming updates
DyWorld_Tech_Increaser=Forgot to increase you science pack costs at the start of the game, or want it higher now that the base has grown? Use Technology Price Amplifier and you can multiply it by this number. Even decimal numbers are allowed, the script will round everything correctly. This will only work on normal research! The tiered and infinite onces are not changed!
